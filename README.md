# SJH-Portfolio-v1

This repo was my first attempt at a portfolio. 
Since we had to start from scratch, it was much more difficult than anything we've done for this class thus far. 
However, having previous sources of code to look back on and build off of was quite helpful in creating a starting point.
For example, the nav bar from the first homework was very helpful in creating the nav bar for this homework. 
In addition, the example given to us was also very helpful in creating a color pallette that could be applied throughout the css sheet.
This project was a mix of being able to synthesize something new while using what we had. 
Using a mix of html and css, this very basic portfolio will hopefully one day showcase the different projects I've completed.
In the future, I hope to make the actual content much better while also cleaning up the formatting and style and making it look much easier to the eye. 

This project was a practice run, and thus the text and images used might seem a little unprofessional. 
For myself, tany text and images used were more like placeholder images more than actual drafts for my portfolio. 
Future portfolio projects will be more professional as I have more content. 

Thanks for reading through these notes, and I hope that this is just the foundation for something much more impressive in the future!
